# üß©Ô∏è IReadOnlyEntityCollection<E>

A read-only, observable collection of entities of type `E`.  
Provides enumeration, presence checking, and notifications for changes in the collection.

### Type Parameters
- `E` ‚Äì The type of entity contained in the collection. Must implement [`IEntity`](#).

---

## Key Features

- **Read-only access** ‚Äì Prevents direct modifications to the collection, ensuring controlled entity management.
- **Change notifications** ‚Äì Provides events (`OnStateChanged`, `OnAdded`, `OnRemoved`) for reactive programming or UI updates.
- **Entity presence checks** ‚Äì Quickly determine if a specific entity exists in the collection via `Contains`.
- **Copy support** ‚Äì Easily copy entities into arrays or other collections for processing.
- **Enumerable** ‚Äì Implements `IReadOnlyCollection<E>` allowing iteration over all entities.
