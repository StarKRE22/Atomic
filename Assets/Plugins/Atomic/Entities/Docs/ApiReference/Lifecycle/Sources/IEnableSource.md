# ðŸ§© IEnableSource

An interface used internally by the framework to represent a **runtime-controllable enable / disable contract**.  
Provides **events** for enable / disable state changes and methods to toggle state programmatically.

> [!NOTE]
> This is an **internal framework interface**. You should **not implement it manually** â€” it is used by the framework infrastructure.

## Overview
`IEnableSource` defines a standard way for objects to be **enabled** and **disabled** during runtime.  
It exposes events for observing state changes, a property to check the state, and methods to control it.
- Used by the framework for **lifecycle management**.
- Not intended for direct implementation in user code.
