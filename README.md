# Atomic Framework
Architectural framework for developing games in C# and Unity

What is Unity Atomic?
---
Atomic Framework is a solution that is designed for developing games in C# and Unity. The main idea of framework is reduce code complexity by separating state and behaviour of game code. To achieve the flexibility and reusability of game mechanics, it is necessary to look towards procedural and reactive programming instead of OOP.

## Installation

_Option #1. Download source code with game example and tutorial_

_Option #2. Download last [Atomic.unitypackage](https://github.com/StarKRE22/Atomic/releases/download/v.1.0/Atomic.unitypackage) from [release notes](https://github.com/StarKRE22/Atomic/releases)_ 

## Add Odin Inspector
> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are many features that don't work by default. To make the most of the Atomic Framework, we recommend adding the [Odin Inspector](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-serializer-89041) plugin to your project. In the future, we plan to move away from dependence on Odin Inspector and write our own tools for integration with Unity
