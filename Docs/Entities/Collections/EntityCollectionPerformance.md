## Performance
TODO:
Insertion & Removal – Near constant-time operations due to hash table management.

Lookup – O(1) average complexity for Contains.

Enumeration – Iterates in insertion order with minimal overhead.

Memory Efficiency – Uses pooled arrays for temporary operations, avoiding unnecessary allocations.

Suitable for real-time applications such as games or simulations where large numbers of entities are managed.
