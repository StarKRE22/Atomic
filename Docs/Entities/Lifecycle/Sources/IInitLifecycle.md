# üß© IInitLifecycle

```csharp
// Assume we have an instance of IInitLifecycle
IInitLifecycle initSource = ...;

// Subscribe to events
initSource.OnInitialized += () => Console.WriteLine("Object initialized");
initSource.OnDisposed += () => Console.WriteLine("Object disposed");

// Check initial state
Console.WriteLine($"Initialized: {initSource.Initialized}");

// Initialize the object
initSource.Init();
Console.WriteLine($"Initialized: {initSource.Initialized}");

// Dispose the object
initSource.Dispose();
Console.WriteLine($"Initialized: {initSource.Initialized}");

// Try disposing again (no event will fire since it's already disposed)
initSource.Dispose();
```

```csharp
public interface IInitLifecycle
```

- **Description:** Represents a **runtime-controllable initialization and disposal contract** for entities or systems.
  Provides events for initialization and disposal state changes, as well as a method to explicitly initialize the
  object.
- **Inheritance:** `IDisposable`
- **Note:** This is an **internal framework interface**. You should **not implement it manually** ‚Äî it is used by the
  framework infrastructure.

public bool Initialized { get; }
```

- **Description:** Indicates whether the object is currently initialized.

```csharp
public void Init();
```

- **Description:** Initializes the object, transitioning it into the **initialized state**.
- **Remarks:** Triggers `OnInitialized`.
