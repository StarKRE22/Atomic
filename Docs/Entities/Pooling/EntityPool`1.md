# üß© EntityPool\<E>

```csharp
public class EntityPool<E> : IEntityPool<E> where E : IEntity
```

- **Description:** A **generic object pool** for managing entities of type `E`.  
  Entities are created via an `IEntityFactory<E>` and reused through the pool to reduce allocations.  
  Supports lifecycle hooks for creation, renting, returning, and disposal of entities.
- **Type Parameter:** `E` ‚Äî The entity type managed by the pool. Must implement [IEntity](../Entities/IEntity.md).
- **Inheritance:** [IEntityPool\<E>](IEntityPool%601.md)
- **Note:** Useful in scenarios with frequent entity creation and destruction to improve performance.
- **See also** [IEntityFactory\<E>](../Factories/IEntityFactory%601.md)

```csharp
// Assume we have a factory for GameEntity
IEntityFactory<GameEntity> factory = ...
EntityPool<GameEntity> pool = new(factory);

// Initialize pool
pool.Init(3);

// Rent entities
var entity1 = pool.Rent();
var entity2 = pool.Rent();

// Return entities to the pool
pool.Return(entity1);
pool.Return(entity2);

// Dispose pool when done
