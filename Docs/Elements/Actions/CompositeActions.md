# ðŸ§© CompositeActions

Represent **groups of actions** that implement the corresponding [IAction](IActions.md)
interfaces. Its follow the [Composite Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern) â€” an action both **groups actions**
and itself **acts as a single action**, preserving a uniform interface.
This allows combining multiple actions into a sequence, which will be invoked **sequentially** when triggered. This is
especially important when game objects and scripts need to execute complex action scenarios.

There are several implementations of composite actions, depending on the number of arguments the actions take:

- [CompositeAction](CompositeAction.md) â€” Non-generic version; works without parameters.
- [CompositeAction&lt;T&gt;](CompositeAction%601.md) â€” Holds actions that take one argument.
- [CompositeAction&lt;T1, T2&gt;](CompositeAction%602.md) â€” Holds actions that take two arguments .
- [CompositeAction&lt;T1, T2, T3&gt;](CompositeAction%603.md) â€” Holds actions that take three arguments.
- [CompositeAction&lt;T1, T2, T3, T4&gt;](CompositeAction%604.md) â€” Holds actions that take four arguments.

## ðŸ—‚ Example of Usage

Below is example of using composite action for game startup:

```csharp
var startupAction = new CompositeAction(
    new ActivatePlayerAction(),
    new ActivateEnemiesAction(),
    new ActivateWeapons(),
    new ActivateGameTimerAction(),
);

```

```csharp
//Usage
startupAction.Invoke();
```
