# üß© TriggerEvents2D

A **Unity MonoBehaviour** that exposes Unity‚Äôs 2D trigger callbacks (`OnTriggerEnter2D`, `OnTriggerExit2D`, `OnTriggerStay2D`) as C# events. This allows external scripts to react to 2D trigger interactions without overriding Unity callbacks.

> [!NOTE]  
> Attach this component to a `GameObject` with a **2D Collider** set as a **Trigger** to receive events.

## Events

#### `OnEntered`
```csharp
public event Action<Collider2D> OnEntered;
```
- **Description:** Invoked when a 2D collider **enters** the trigger zone.
- **Parameter:** `Collider2D` ‚Äî the collider that entered.
- **Unity Equivalent:** `MonoBehaviour.OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D)`

#### `OnExited`
```csharp
public event Action<Collider2D> OnExited;
```
- **Description:** Invoked when a 2D collider **exits** the trigger zone.
- **Parameter:** `Collider2D` ‚Äî the collider that exited.
- **Unity Equivalent:** `MonoBehaviour.OnTriggerExit2D(Collider2D)`

#### `OnStay`
```csharp
public event Action<Collider2D> OnStay;
```
- **Description:** Invoked every frame while a 2D collider **remains** inside the trigger.
- **Parameter:** `Collider2D` ‚Äî the collider that is staying.
- **Unity Equivalent:** `MonoBehaviour.OnTriggerStay2D(Collider2D)`

---

## Unity Callbacks
These methods are automatically called by Unity and forward events to C# subscribers.

#### `OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D)`
```csharp
public void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D other);
```
- **Description:** Called when a 2D collider enters the trigger.
- **Dispatches:** `OnEntered`

#### `OnTriggerExit2D(Collider2D)`
```csharp
public void OnTriggerExit2D(Collider2D other);
```
- **Description:** Called when a 2D collider exits the trigger.
- **Dispatches:** `OnExited`

#### `OnTriggerStay2D(Collider2D)`
```csharp
public void OnTriggerStay2D(Collider2D other);
```
- **Description:** Called every frame while a 2D collider remains in the trigger.
- **Dispatches:** `OnStay`

## üóÇ Example Usage

### 1. Add Component
Add a **`TriggerEvents2D`** component to a `GameObject` with a **2D Collider** set as a trigger.

### 2. Create Script
Create a script called `Trigger2DExample`:

```csharp
public class Trigger2DExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField]
    private TriggerEvents2D _triggerEvents;

    private void OnEnable()
    {
        _triggerEvents.OnEntered += HandleEnter;
        _triggerEvents.OnExited  += HandleExit;
        _triggerEvents.OnStay    += HandleStay;
    }

    private void OnDisable()
    {
        _triggerEvents.OnEntered -= HandleEnter;
        _triggerEvents.OnExited  -= HandleExit;
        _triggerEvents.OnStay    -= HandleStay;
    }

    private void HandleEnter(Collider2D other)
        => Debug.Log($"2D Trigger entered by {other.gameObject.name}");

    private void HandleExit(Collider2D other)
        => Debug.Log($"2D Trigger exited by {other.gameObject.name}");

    private void HandleStay(Collider2D other)
        => Debug.Log($"Still inside 2D trigger: {other.gameObject.name}");
}
```

### 3. Attach Script
Attach the `Trigger2DExample` script to the **same GameObject**.

### 4. Run and Test
Enter **Play Mode** in Unity. When other 2D colliders interact with the trigger, logs will appear in the **Console**.

## üìù Notes
- Requires a **2D Collider** set as a **Trigger**.
- Works with **2D physics** (`Collider2D`) and is not compatible with 3D triggers (`Collider`).
- Decouples trigger handling from MonoBehaviour lifecycle methods.
- Supports multiple subscribers per event.
