# üß© ISignal Interfaces

Defines a family of contracts for **reactive event sources**. It provides a lightweight abstraction for subscribing to
notifications and reacting to events, optionally with arguments. When subscribing to a signal, the method returns
a [subscription](../Signals/Subscription.md) struct.

## üóÇ Example of Usage

Below is an example of how to use `ISignal` for triggering a **sound effect** together with the `Atomic.Entities`
framework.

```csharp
// Create an entity with a "FireEvent" signal property
var entity = new Entity("Character");
entity.AddValue("FireEvent", new BaseEvent()); //ISignal
entity.AddValue("AudioSource", audioSource);
```

```csharp
// Use "FireEvent" through the ISignal interface
[Serializable]
public class FireSFXBehaviour : IEntityInit, IEntityDispose
{
    [Serializable]
    private AudioClip _fireSFX;

    private AudioSource _audioSource;
    private ISignal _fireSignal;
    
    public void Init(IEntity entity)
    {
        _audioSource = entity.GetValue<AudioSource>("AudioSource");
        _fireSignal = entity.GetValue<ISignal>("FireEvent");
        _fireSignal.Subscribe(this.OnFire);
    }
    
    public void Dispose(IEntity entity)
    {
        _fireSignal.Unsubscribe(this.OnFire);
    }
    
    private void OnFire()
    {
        _audioSource.PlayOneShot(_fireSFX);
    }
}
```
