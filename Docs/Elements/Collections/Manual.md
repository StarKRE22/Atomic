# ðŸ§© Collections

Provides a set of **reactive collection types** such as arrays, lists, dictionaries, and sets. These collections
automatically notify subscribers of changes, making them ideal for **data binding, UI updates, and reactive programming
**. Both read-only and fully mutable reactive collections are supported, allowing fine-grained control over data access
and modification.
