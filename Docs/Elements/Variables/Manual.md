# ðŸ§© Variables

Provides a set of interfaces and classes for working with **reactive variables, proxy variables, and Unity-specific
variable types**. It builds on the concept of reactive values but adds more flexibility by allowing variables to act as
intermediaries or proxies, which can observe, modify, or synchronize underlying data.
