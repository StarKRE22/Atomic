# ðŸ§© Reactive Variables

For convenience, several specialized implementations of reactive variables are provided. It is recommended to use them,
as they compare values without relying on `EqualityComparer`, which makes them slightly faster than the generic
[ReactiveVariable&lt;T&gt;](ReactiveVariable.md) version.
