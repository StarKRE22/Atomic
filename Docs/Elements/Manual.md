# ‚öõÔ∏è Atomic.Elements

A library of atomic elements for constructing complex game objects and systems in `Unity` and `C#`.
The solution includes **constants, variables, reactive properties, collections, events, and actions**, enabling
developers to quickly assemble any game entity like a `LEGO Constructor`.

## üìù Requirements

The Atomic.Elements requires **Unity 6** or **.NET 7+**. Make sure your development environment meets these requirements
before using the framework.

---

## üéõ Using Odin Inspector

For better **debugging**, **configuration**, and **visualization** of game state, we **optionally recommend**
using [Odin Inspector](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-serializer-89041). The
framework **works without Odin**, but Odin makes inspection and tweaking much easier.

## üîç API Reference

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the core interfaces, classes, and utilities in `Atomic.Elements`. It
covers tools for **reactive programming, event handling, Unity integration, and general-purpose development**. Use this
section as a guide for integrating `Atomic.Elements` into your Unity or C# projects, taking advantage of **reactive
patterns, composable structures, and modular design**.

### üß© Collections

Provides a set of **reactive collection types** such as arrays, lists, dictionaries, and sets. These collections
automatically notify subscribers of changes, making them ideal for **data binding, UI updates, and reactive programming
**. Both read-only and fully mutable reactive collections are supported, allowing fine-grained control over data access
and modification.

### üß© Time

Provides a set of tools for managing **timers, cooldowns, countdowns, stopwatches, and time sources**. It allows
developers to track and control time-related events in a consistent and reactive manner, making it useful for gameplay
mechanics, scheduling, and periodic updates. The module supports flexible time representations, including fixed and
variable intervals, as well as reactive notifications for state changes.

### üß© Utilities

Provides a collection of **utility classes and components** that simplify common tasks in Unity and C# development. This
includes handling animation and collision events, trigger detection, disposable actions, optional references, and
various helper extensions. These utilities help reduce boilerplate code and make systems more modular and maintainable.
