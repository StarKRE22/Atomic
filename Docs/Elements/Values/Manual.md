# ðŸ§© Values

Provides a set of interfaces and classes for working with **reactive values and constants**. It allows developers to
handle both immutable constants and dynamic, reactive data in a consistent way. This is particularly useful in scenarios
where values need to be observed or updated in real-time, such as game development, UI bindings, or simulation systems.
