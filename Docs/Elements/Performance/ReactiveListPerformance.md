# ðŸ”¥ ReactiveList Performance

The performance comparison below was measured on a **MacBook with Apple M1** and for collections containing **1000
elements of type `object`**. The table shows median execution times of key operations, illustrating the overhead of the
reactive wrapper.

| Operation  | List (Median Î¼s) | ReactiveList (Median Î¼s) |
|------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Add        | 30.15            | 31.20                    |

`ReactiveList` shows slightly higher latency when setting elements (`Indexer Set`) due to event invocation, but is
faster in some removal operations (`RemoveAt`) thanks to internal optimizations.
