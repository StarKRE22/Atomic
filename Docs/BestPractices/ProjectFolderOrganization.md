# ðŸ“Œ File System Organization

In this guide, Iâ€™ll share how I organize my projectâ€™s file system when working with the **Atomic Framework**.
This approach keeps the project **scalable**, **clean**, and **intuitive**, even as it grows in complexity.

## ðŸ“‚ Organizing the Assets Folder

At the root of the project, inside the `Assets` folder, create a separate **Game** directory.  
This keeps the main `Assets` folder tidy and prevents clutter when adding plugins or tools.

```
Assets/
â”‚
â”œâ”€ 3rdParty/ # Third-party libraries and plugins                 
â”œâ”€ Game/ # Game-specific scenes, scripts, and assets             
â”œâ”€ Modules/ # Reusable systems shared across projects
â”œâ”€ Plugins/ # DLLs and external plugins
â”œâ”€ Settings/ # Project settings, ScriptableObjects, configurations
â”œâ”€ Tools/ # Editor tools and internal utilities
```

---

## ðŸ“‚ Organizing the Game Folder

Inside the `Game` folder, group assets by type â€” `Scripts`, `Prefabs`, `Materials`, `Animations`, etc.
This ensures that artists and developers can intuitively find where each type of asset belongs. For tests, we recommend
creating a separate folder.

```
Game/
â”‚
â”œâ”€ Animations/            
â”œâ”€ Audio/                 
â”œâ”€ Configs/               
â”œâ”€ Materials/             
â”œâ”€ Prefabs/               
â”œâ”€ Scenes/                
â”œâ”€ Scripts/
â”œâ”€ Tests/ 
```

This clear separation helps teams work together without confusion about where to place or find assets.

## ðŸ“‚ Organizing the Scripts Folder

Inside the `Scripts` folder, create an **Assembly Definition (`.asmdef`)** file to make your code modular and easily testable. 
Then, organize your scripts into three main areas: `App`, `Gameplay`, and `UI`.

```
Assets/
â”‚
â”œâ”€ Game/
â”‚ â”œâ”€ Scripts/
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€ App/                    # Application-level systems
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€ Bootstrap/            # Initialization and startup logic
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€ SaveSystem/           # Save/load game data
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€ LevelSystem/          # Level management and progression
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€ Authorization/        # Login, authentication, permissions
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€ Quit/                 # Application quit/exit logic
â”‚ â”‚
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€ Gameplay/               # All gameplay systems and mechanics
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€ Common/               # Shared utilities and gameplay components
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€ GameEntities/         # NPCs, items, objects, and other entities
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€ GameContext/          # Core game rules and state management
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€ PlayerContext/        # Player-related systems and mechanics
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€ Weapons/              # Weapon scripts and logic
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€ Abilities/            # Player and entity abilities
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€ Level/                # Level scripts, triggers, props, and interactive elements
â”‚ â”‚
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€ UI/                     # All UI elements for the project
â”‚ â”‚   â”œâ”€ MenuUI/               # Main menu, loading screens, settings
â”‚ â”‚   â”œâ”€ GameplayUI/           # In-game HUD, pop-ups, and in-game menus
â”‚ â”‚   â””â”€ Common/               # Reusable UI elements (buttons, panels, fonts)
```

### Folder Roles

- **App** â€“ Handles application-level systems such as bootstrapping, menu navigation, save/load, and other global services.
- **Gameplay** â€“ Contains all gameplay-related logic, including entities, player systems, abilities, weapons, levels, and shared utilities.
- **UI** â€“ Keeps all user interface elements in one place, separating menu screens from in-game HUD and common reusable components.

Structuring `Gameplay` this way ensures each domain (e.g., `PlayerContext`, `GameEntities`, `GameContext`) has its own folder, making it easier to locate and maintain specific systems or mechanics.

### Why This Structure Works

1. **Clear separation of concerns** â€“ App, Gameplay, and UI are fully separated.
2. **Modular and scalable** â€“ Easy to add new mechanics, weapons, levels, or UI without clutter.
3. **Supports testing and assembly definitions** â€“ `.asmdef` files allow modular builds and unit tests.
4. **Reusability** â€“ Common utilities and UI components can be reused across systems.

## ðŸ“‚ Organizing the GameEntities Folder

For **game entities**, organize them into three main domains: `Core`, `View`, and `Content`. This separation ensures clean architecture, scalability, and easier maintenance.

- **Core** â†’ Contains reusable gameplay mechanics and logic, such as movement, rotation, and jumping. This is independent of visuals.
- **View** â†’ Handles all visual representation, including animations, effects, and UI elements that reflect Core mechanics.
- **Content** â†’ Holds concrete game entities like characters, enemies, weapons, items, and projectiles, combining Core logic with View components.

```
GameEntities/
â”‚
â”œâ”€ Core/                   # Core gameplay mechanics
â”‚ â”œâ”€ Move/                 # Movement logic
â”‚ â”œâ”€ Rotation/             # Rotation logic
â”‚ â””â”€ Jump/                 # Jump logic
â”‚
â”œâ”€ View/                   # Visuals and presentation
â”‚ â”œâ”€ Move/                 # Movement visuals
â”‚ â”œâ”€ Rotation/             # Rotation visuals
â”‚ â””â”€ Jump/                 # Jump visuals
â”‚
â””â”€ Content/                # Concrete game entities
  â”œâ”€ Character/            # Player characters
  â”œâ”€ PickUps/              # Pick-up items
  â”œâ”€ Enemies/              # Enemy units
  â”œâ”€ Projectiles/          # Bullets, missiles, etc.
  â””â”€ Weapons/              # Weapon implementations
```

### Benefits of This Structure

1. **Separation of concerns** â€“ Core logic is independent of visuals, and Content only combines them.
2. **Scalable** â€“ New mechanics, visual effects, or entities can be added without breaking existing systems.
3. **Easy to maintain** â€“ Each layer has a clear responsibility, making debugging and testing simpler.
4. **Reusable** â€“ Core mechanics can be reused across different entities or projects without duplication.

## ðŸ“‚ Organizing the GameContext & PlayerContext Folders

Both `GameContext` and `PlayerContext` should be organized by **feature**. 
This makes it easier to locate, maintain, and expand individual systems.

Examples of features you might include:

- **Inventory** â€“ Handles player items, pickups, equipment, and item management.
- **Score** â€“ Tracks player progress, points, achievements, and leaderboards.
- **Controllers/** â€“ Manages inputs of movement, jumping, rotation, and physics interactions.
- **Abilities/** â€“ Manages player abilities and their cooldowns.

This **feature-based organization** ensures each system has a clear responsibility and makes the codebase modular and scalable.

## ðŸ“‚ Organizing the Modules Folder

The **Modules** folder stores universal features and systems that can be reused across multiple projects. 
This prevents code duplication and speeds up future development.

```
Assets/
â”‚
â”œâ”€ Modules/              
â”‚ â”œâ”€ DialogueSystem/ # Dialogue and conversation system
â”‚ â”œâ”€ UpgradeFeature/ # Character/item upgrade system
â”‚ â”œâ”€ BehaviourTree/ # AI behavior trees
â”‚ â”œâ”€ GridInventory/ # Grid-based inventory system
```

Modules are designed to be **independent of specific game logic**,  
allowing you to easily plug them into any new project built on the same framework.

> [!NOTE]
> ðŸ§© Keep a simple rule in mind:  
> *A mechanic should always live in the domain it belongs to.* 
> The folder name should directly reflect the **use case** or **system** it represents.
