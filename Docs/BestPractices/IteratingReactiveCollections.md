# üìå Iterating over Reactive Collections

When using reactive collections such
as [ReactiveArray](../Elements/Collections/ReactiveArray.md), [ReactiveList](../Elements/Collections/ReactiveList.md), [ReactiveLinkedList](../Elements/Collections/ReactiveLinkedList.md), [ReactiveHashSet](../Elements/Collections/ReactiveHashSet.md),
and [ReactiveDictionary](../Elements/Collections/ReactiveDictionary.md), it is important to understand that **each
reactive wrapper introduces a small overhead**. Knowing how to **optimize performance** becomes crucial when working
with a large number of elements.

## Prefer Concrete Types

When iterating via interfaces using `IEnumerator<T>`, the iterator may **box**,  
causing **heap allocations** and **GC pressure**. To avoid this, use the **concrete collection type** whenever possible.

---

### ‚ùå Has Boxing (IReactiveList\<E>)

```csharp
// Assume we have an instance of interface type
IReactiveList<string> items ...
{
    "Axe",
    "Helmet",
    "Potion",
    "Sword"
};

// Reference type of "IEnumerator<string>"
foreach (string item in items)
{
    ...
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ No Boxing (ReactiveList\<E>)

```csharp
// Assume we have a concrete instance of collection implementation
ReactiveList<string> items = ...;

// Value type of "ReactiveList.Enumerator<string>"
foreach (string item in items)
{
    ...
}
```

## Iterating over ReactiveArray & ReactiveList

When iterating over a large number of elements in a [ReactiveArray](../Elements/Collections/ReactiveArray.md)
or [ReactiveList](../Elements/Collections/ReactiveList.md), **always prefer a `for` loop over `foreach`**. Using
`foreach` involves additional operations, including **struct enumerator allocation on the stack**, which can slightly
slow down iteration.

> üí° Performance tests confirm this behavior for both
> [ReactiveList](../Elements/Performance/ReactiveListPerformance.md) and
> [ReactiveArray](../Elements/Performance/ReactiveArrayPerformance.md).

---

### ‚ùå Bad Practice

```csharp
ReactiveList<string> items = ... // 1000+ elements

foreach (string item in items)
{
    ...
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Good Practice

```csharp
ReactiveList<string> items = ... // 1000+ elements

for (int i = 0, count = items.Count; i < count; i++)
{
    string item = items[i];
    ...
}
```

> üí° It‚Äôs recommended to **cache the `Count` property**  
> to avoid repeatedly calling the getter during iteration.

## Iterating over ReactiveLinkedList, ReactiveDictionary, ReactiveHashSet

In contrast to arrays and lists, **always prefer `foreach` over `for`**  
when iterating
over [ReactiveLinkedList](../Elements/Collections/ReactiveLinkedList.md), [ReactiveDictionary](../Elements/Collections/ReactiveDictionary.md)
or [ReactiveHashSet](../Elements/Collections/ReactiveHashSet.md).

This is especially important for `ReactiveLinkedList`, which is a **doubly-linked list** ‚Äî accessing elements by index
has **O(N) complexity**, so using a `for` loop would be inefficient.

---

### ‚ùå Bad Practice

```csharp
ReactiveLinkedList<string> items = ... // 1000+ elements

for (int i = 0, count = items.Count; i < count; i++)
{
    string item = items[i];
    ...
}

```

---

### ‚úÖ Good Practice

```csharp
ReactiveLinkedList<string> items = ... // 1000+ elements

foreach (string item in items)
{
    ...
}
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Iterating over `ReactiveLinkedList`, `ReactiveDictionary`, `ReactiveHashSet`

In contrast to arrays and lists, **always prefer `foreach` over `for`** when iterating over `ReactiveLinkedList`,
`ReactiveDictionary`, or `ReactiveHashSet`. This is especially important for `ReactiveLinkedList`, which is 
a **doubly-linked list** where accessing elements by index has **O(N) complexity**. Using a `for` loop with indexing would
therefore be very inefficient.

#### ‚ùå Bad Practice

```csharp
ReactiveLinkedList<string> items = ... //1000+ elements

for (int i = 0, count = items.Count; i < count; i++)
{
    string item = items[i];
    ...
}
```

#### ‚úÖ Good Practice

```csharp
ReactiveLinkedList<string> items = ... //1000+ elements

foreach(string item in items)
{
    ...
}
```
